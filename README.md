ğŸŒ¼ What This App Does
This is a machine learning web application built using Streamlit that predicts the type of Iris flower based on user input.

ğŸŒ¸ Here's how it works:
You enter 4 values:

ğŸŒ¿ Sepal Length (cm)

ğŸŒ¿ Sepal Width (cm)

ğŸŒ¸ Petal Length (cm)

ğŸŒ¸ Petal Width (cm)

The app sends these values to a CatBoost machine learning model trained on the famous Iris dataset.

The model then predicts which of the 3 Iris flower species your data belongs to:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica
